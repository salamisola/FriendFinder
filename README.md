# FriendFinder
Summary:
This is FriendFinder. The App helps the user locate a friend or soulmate. This is not just another dating App. It would not throw you into the jungle of undesirables.  It takes the user through a survey and based on their responses, the App matches them with the best fit for a friend from a list of other people who have previously taken the survey! 

Operations:

FriendFinder takes in responses to all of the pre-defined survey questions form the user and compares the resonses through the use of an embeded algorithm and matches two users with the lower difference in the calculation. This forms the closest option for a friend recommendation by the APP.

Issues to fix:
There was a conflict of two different bootstrap links (codes) used that caused the submit function in survey.html to malfunction. This was eventually fixed but left a little problem with the look and fonts on the survey page. this is being worked on to be fixed. Every other functions are working.

Conflict resolved:
Conflict of boothstrap resolved. Survey page better formatted wiht a nicer look and feel.
